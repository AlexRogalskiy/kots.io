You can check if there are any changes on your license through the "License" tab on the Admin Console.

## Checking for Updates

#### 1. Online licenses

Click the "Check for updates" button at the bottom of the license page to check if there are any updates on your current license. This will only check if there are any changes detected and will not apply those changes automatically.

Click the "Upload license" button at the bottom of the license page and select the latest license from your machine. The Admin Console will then check if there are any updates on your current license but will not apply the changes automatically.
