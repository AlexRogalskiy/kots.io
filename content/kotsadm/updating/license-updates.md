You can check if there are any changes on your license through the "License" tab on the Admin Console.

## Checking for Updates
Click the "Sync license" button at the bottom of the license page to check if there are any updates to your current license. This will only check if there are any changes detected and will not apply those changes automatically.

## Applying Updates
If there are changes detected on your license, the "Sync license" button will change to "Apply updates". Click on "Apply updates" to update your license and create a new release with the updated license.
