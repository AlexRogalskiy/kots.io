A [Preflight spec](https://troubleshoot.sh/reference/preflights/) makes an application's cluster dependencies explicit, enabling kots and the Admin Console to provide operators with clear feedback on any missing requirements or incompatibilities in the target environment before an application is deployed.

Preflight checks can even be run independently, via the [Preflight kubectl plugin](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/preflight/overview/).
