When deploying applications with native Helm charts, your charts are deployed to the cluster before any other kubernetes yaml within your app. This includes CRDs, so any custom resources referenced within a native Helm chart must themselves be created by a native Helm chart.

Helm charts do not have a defined order in which they will be applied. If one Helm chart depends on another, that dependency should be enforced with Helm.
