# API tokens
Tokens are used for programmatic access to Vendor Portal functions.

## use case
The most common use case is for programmatically creating and promoting releases, as well as creating customers and licenses. This is useful for CI/CD systems or other automations.

Permissions define the CRUD access for APIs

* `read` permission allows the user to only read the state of objects
* `write` permission allows the user to create, update, and delete objects.
