KOTS applications that are packaged and delivered through the Replicated [Vendor Portal](https://vendor.replicated.com) use per-customer licenses to install. The license file is a unique identifier for the customer and the release channel, but also includes additional entitlements data that is used by the Admin Console and is extensible to use in any application.
