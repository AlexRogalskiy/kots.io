{{<fixes>}}
* Fixed a bug where two kotsadm instances reports as a single instance.
* Fixed a bug that showed "Node drain successful" on all node rows instead of just the node that was actually drained.
* Fixed a bug where application metadata config map is not updated with the new app name.
* Fixed a bug that caused having two different instances of the Admin Console running in different clusters due to disaster recovery to report back to the vendor as if they are the same instance.
