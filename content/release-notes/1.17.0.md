{{<features>}}
* GitOps - Added Github Enterprise support.
* Ability to change to a different snapshot storage provider using the UI on the Snapshot Settings page. 
* "Internal Storage" snapshot provider option has been added to the snapshot providers list for kURL embedded clusters. This allows the user to easily return to the default snapshot configuration when another provider (such as AWS S3 or Google Storage) has been configured. 
* Added `when` field support for config groups.
* Added support for [installing Admin Console into an existing cluster using an airgap bundle](https://kots.io/kotsadm/installing/airgap-packages/).
{{</features>}}

{{<changes>}}
* The most recent support bundles on the Admin Console troubleshoot page are now shown first. 
* Helpful warnings now appear on the Version History page if the user attempts to deploy a version of the application with invalid YAML. 
* Removed the KOTS metadata that was added to all application manifests. Which included the local application and the version sequence injected as annotations to all deployed manifests.
* Improved the granularity of the airgap upload progress indicator.
* Removed the "Re-analyze" button from the troubleshoot support bundle analysis page.
* Auto deploy the app's first version when installing the app and no preflight checks are available or preflight checks pass.
* Update to import k8s 1.18 libraries.
* Show a descriptive error message when `kubectl kots download` is called with an app slug that does not exist.

{{<fixes>}}
* Fixed a bug in KOTS CLI where the `--deploy` flag when checking for [upstream](https://kots.io/kots-cli/upstream/) updates fails to deploy the latest release.
* Fixed a bug in KOTS CLI [install command](https://kots.io/kots-cli/install/) where automated installs fail to deploy if no preflight checks are configured for the application. 
* Fixed a bug in KOTS CLI where checking for updates shows `There are no application updates available` even when updates are actually available.
* Fixed an issue where license expiration isn't checked until after fetching application.
* Fixed a bug where preflight checks were not triggered for airgap or automated installs.
* Fixed a bug where Snapshots scheduled `@daily` run just on day 1 of the month instead of every day.
* Fixed an issue on the "View Files" tab in the Admin Console that shows full path instead of just subdirectory.
* Fixed an issue where the minio image included a binary with CAP_CHOWN set.
* Fixed visual glitches on the buttons of the [TLS certificate page](https://kurl.sh/docs/install-with-kurl/setup-tls-certs) that appears during embedded cluster installation. 
* Fixed snapshot hooks status.
* Fixed backup size on snapshots list.
* Fixed Velero checks on Snapshot settings.
* Fixed a bug where clicking `Save changes` in the "Registry settings" tab without changing anything permanently breaks the registry connection to the Admin Console. Repairing this connection then requires manual intervention outside the Admin Console. 
* Fixed an issue where the diff viewer in Kotsadm does not scroll to the end of the file.
* Fixed an issue where pushing images during an airgap installation hangs when the progress bar is nearly complete. Attempting to reload the page will either fix the problem, or prompt another upload that will work the second time around. 
* Fixed a bug where automatic update checks result in duplicate releases on the Version History page.
* Fixed a bug where re-uploading an airgap bundle does not work if previous upload fails.
