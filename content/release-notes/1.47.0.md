{{<features>}}
* Added the ability to opt-in to removing the MinIO object store dependency for KOTS for [kURL embedded](https://kurl.sh/docs/add-ons/kots#advanced-install-options) and [existing cluster](https://kots.io/kotsadm/updating/updating-admin-console/#online-installations) upgrades. If this opt-in is selected as part of the upgrade, KOTS will migrate all application archives and support bundles to a blob/filesystem that is part of the new KOTS Admin Console statefulset. The migration process is irreversible. This option is also available for new KOTS installs on [kURL embedded](https://kurl.sh/docs/add-ons/kots#advanced-install-options) and [existing clusters](https://kots.io/kotsadm/installing/online-install/#kots-install). When this option is specified on new installations on existing clusters, MinIO will not be deployed or used. For embedded clusters, kURL might still deploy MinIO to be used for other functionality.
* Added a config option for repeatable items. This allows for more than one value to be provided under a single config item. The config item will target a YAML array or YAML file, which will be duplicated and rendered for as many values as are provided.
* Added experimental support for a new Helm rendering workflow that supports hook and hook weight for v3 Helm charts. The new workflow applies to the following hooks: pre-install, post-install, pre-upgrade, post-upgrade. This feature is experimental and only available to vendors who have requested access.
