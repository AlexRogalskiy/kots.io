{{<features>}}
* Added `kubectl kots get config` command to export config values. This includes a `--decrypt` flag to decrypt sensitive values.
* The "Internal Storage" snapshots will now use persistent volume-backed storage when the `disableS3` flag is set to `true` for embedded clusters. See the [documentation for the kURL addon](https://kurl.sh/docs/add-ons/kotsadm) for more information on removing KOTS' usage of object storage.

{{<fixes>}}
* Fixes a bug that caused analyzers to surface errors in namespaces not used by the application when Admin Console has cluster access in existing cluster installs.
* Fixed an issue that would cause image pull secrets to be rendered in the Admin Console namespace rather than the `namespace` specified in the kots.io/v1beta1.HelmChart when using `useHelmInstall`.
* Fixed the `kots pull` cli command to properly inject imagePullSecrets when using Helm Charts with useHelmInstall set to true.
