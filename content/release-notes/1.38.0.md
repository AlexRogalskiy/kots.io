{{<fixes>}}
* Default values of password types are hidden on the [application config screen](/kotsadm/installing/online-install/#config-screen). 
* Fixed a bug that caused the Azure Blob Storage option to be hidden in snapshot settings.
* Fixed a bug that could cause errors switching snapshot providers.
* Fixed a bug where Kots would watch for changes to Kubernetes Namespaces even when the `additionalNamespaces` parameter was not set, causing excessive logging when `requireMinimalRBACPrivileges` is set and the kotsadm and kotsadm-operator Service Accounts have insufficient permissions in the cluster.
