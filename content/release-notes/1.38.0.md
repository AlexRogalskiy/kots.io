* [kots install](/kots-cli/install/) and [kots upstream upgrade](/kots-cli/upstream/) commands now support the `--disable-image-push` flag.

{{</changes>}}

{{<fixes>}}
* Default values of password types are hidden on the [application config screen](/kotsadm/installing/online-install/#config-screen). 
* Fixed a bug that caused the Azure Blob Storage option to be hidden in snapshot settings.
* Fixed a bug that could cause errors switching snapshot providers.
* Fixed a bug where kots would watch for changes to Kubernetes Namespaces even when the [`additionalNamespaces`](https://kots.io/reference/v1beta1/application/#additionalnamespaces) parameter was not set, causing excessive logging when [`requireMinimalRBACPrivileges`](https://kots.io/reference/v1beta1/application/#requireminimalrbacprivileges) is set and the kotsadm and kotsadm-operator Service Accounts have insufficient permissions in the cluster.
* Silenced excessive logging by the kots operator when the application deploy loop fails repetedly.
* Fixed an issue that would cause a broken login screen icon when the [Identity Service](https://kots.io/vendor/identity-service/configuring-identity-service/) is enabled and there in no application [icon](https://kots.io/reference/v1beta1/application/#icon).
* Fixed a bug that caused prometheus metrics not to work when kotsadm is not running in the default namespace.
* Fixed a bug that allowed deploying an update without requiring configuration when there are non-set required config items.
