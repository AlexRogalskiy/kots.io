{{<features>}}
* Ability to apply `count(), min(), max(), and sum()` aggregate functions to node resource analyzers. Especially useful for preflight checks against resources on a node (e.g., `min(memoryCapacity) >= 16Gi`). See [Node Resources Analyzer](https://troubleshoot.sh/reference/analyzers/node-resources/) documentation for more details.  
{{</features>}}

{{<changes>}}
* Improved performance of application and license updates by caching image privacy status when the release has not changed.
* Past preflight results are now always displayed on the version history page, even when they were successful.
* Progress indicators have been added to the license upload screen.
* Decreased image side of the kotsadm-api image by removing unnecessary inclusion of kubectl.
{{</changes>}}

{{<fixes>}}
* Config page fails to load when current release has `'{{repl ...}}'` [template functions](/reference/template-functions) that are over 80 characters.
* License expiration not enforced in airgap installations. After this fix, any new attempts to update or install applications on an expired license will not succeed.
* Any changes to `default:` values on [config item types](/reference/v1beta1/config/#available-item-types) are not respected on upgrades to a new release. 
* Application logo in the navigation bar does not update when switching to another kots application. It always shows the logo for the first app. [Issue-910](https://github.com/replicatedhq/kotsadm/issues/910)
* "Upload license" button should not remain visible during the process of a license upload.
* The "diffing releases" view incorrectly overlaps with version history when the differences between releases is small. 
* `kubectl kots upload` command shown for editing application patches on the "View files" tab fails to include the correct namespace.
* Incorrect "Anonymous uploads have been disabled" message appears during initial setup of embedded cluster installations. Fixed by redirecting to hostname, which is now stored in the kotsadm-tls secret.
